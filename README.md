# ☕ My Daily Brew v6.5.1 - Grand Reopening!

A cozy, comprehensive habit tracker, task manager, and daily reflection app with warm café aesthetics. Now with live weather, push notifications, improved music, and a safer UI!

## 🎉 What's New in v6.5

### 🌤️ Live Weather
- Current temperature displays next to the date in the header
- Weather icon shows conditions (☀️🌧️❄️⛈️ etc.)
- Uses Open-Meteo API (free, no key required)
- Auto-refreshes every 30 minutes
- Requires location permission

### 🔔 Push Notifications
- **5-Minute Warning**: Get notified 5 minutes before tasks are due
- **Due Now Alert**: Notified again when the task time arrives (with vibration)
- **Timer Complete**: Get notified when your focus session ends (works in background!)
- **Smart Tracking**: Won't send duplicate notifications for the same task
- **Test Button**: Verify notifications work from Settings
- **Notification Prompt**: New users see a friendly banner to enable notifications

### 🎵 Improved Music
Testers said the old music was "too slow and creepy" - here's what changed:

| Sound | Old Tempo | New Tempo | Improvement |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Piano | 1800ms | 1400ms | 22% faster |
| Chimes | 2200ms | 1800ms | 18% faster |
| Bowls | 3500ms | 2800ms | 20% faster |

**Better Harmonies:**
- Piano now uses jazz 7th chords (Cmaj7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7, Dm7)
- Pentatonic scales for naturally pleasant melodies
- Lower skip chance = more continuous music
- Richer, warmer sound overall

### 🔒 XP Exploit Prevention
- Each habit/task can only award XP once per day
- Re-checking and unchecking won't give duplicate XP
- Progress still tracked accurately

### 🗑️ Safer Delete Actions
- **No more swipe-to-delete** - prevents accidental deletions
- Swipe right = complete (habits & tasks)
- Delete button (🗑️) now shows confirmation modal
- "Are you sure?" prompt before any deletion
- 4-second undo toast after deletion

## 🏠 6 Mood Presets
Each mood changes tempo, density, reverb, and brightness:

| Mood | Icon | Speed | Description |

| **Upbeat** | ✨ | Fast | Energetic flow |
